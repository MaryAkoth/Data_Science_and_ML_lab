# Lab 1: Introduction to Python Programming Language
# Objective
This lab introduces the foundational concepts of the Python programming language. Students learn how to declare variables, work with basic data types, understand sequence structures, and use built-in functions to inspect data types.

# Tools Used
Python 3.x
Google Colab

# Step-by-Step Process
1. Notebook Introduction (Google colab)
   
# python programming
2. Variable Declaration
firstname = 'Mary'
print(firstname)
3. Working With Data Types
x = 2
y = 3.14
z = 2 + 3j
Checking the variable types:

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
4. Sequence Data Types

## Sequence
### Creating list, tuple, and range:

list_ = [1,2,3,4,5]
tuple_ = (1,2,3,4,5)
range_ = range(1,5)

### Checking their types:
print(type(list_))
print(type(tuple_))
Commands Executed

Command	Purpose
-firstname = 'Mary'	Assign a string variable
-type(x)	Check data type of variable
-list_ = [1,2,3,4,5]	Create a Python list
-tuple_ = (1,2,3,4,5)	Create a Python tuple
-range(1,5)	Create a range sequence

# Key Observations / Lessons Learned

-Python supports several numeric types, including integers, floats, and complex numbers.
-type() is useful for identifying variable data types.
-Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable, and ranges efficiently generate sequences.
-Google colab facilitates interactive coding and testing.


# Conclusion

This lab provided a foundational understanding of Python variables, data types, and sequence structures. These basics are crucial for progressing into data analysis, data science, and machine learning workflows.
